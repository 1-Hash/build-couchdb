Planned Features
================

Bugs
====

 * all.rake is legacy code which should be refactored into meaningful .rake
   components
 * Should not use Git as a shortcut to clean up the source trees after building
 * There should be no os_dependencies task. Dependencies should be detected by
   the specific task that needs them and only warn the admin about what to do.
